# Catalog 

<p>
The purpose of this project was just to learn about MVC and CRUD operations. I implemented as much as I could and got through all of the operations, but I quickly
came to a dead end when I tried to connect my code to a permanent database. I'm still trying to figure out how to use API's with databases, and I have found no luck.

However I did lear a lot from this project and I will revisit it when I gain more knowledge.
